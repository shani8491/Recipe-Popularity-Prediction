The chili was amazing! It was easy to make and everyone absolutely loved it. It will now be a staple meal in our house."

The only change I made was to add a jalapeno with the seeds. My brother-in-law was asking me the other day to make that &#34;soup&#34; meaning chili that has the white beans. Ha! So I guess I&#39;ll make it again. Thank you.

I used only 1/4 tsp oregano, instead of 4 garlic cloves I used garlic powder, I also added a handful of spinach, and some wild rice. I added a little of a seasoning blend, and added fresh ground pepper."

My only issue was that the 1 1/2 cups of water was not nearly enough liquid! I ended up adding about double that amount. I substituted beef broth for the water and it was a great addition. I also only used black beans, two cans, and I used a whole bag of frozen corn instead of canned. It was a huge hit with my whole family!"

I used 2 egg whites, rather than the 2 eggs. I also baked this in 2 greased and floured 8&#34; square pans for 35 minutes-I used a cake tester to determine whether the cakes were done!  I&#39;d used 3 Tbsp. of the cake mixture to mix in with the chopped strawberries.  Instead of using a strawberry icing, I used 2 cups of confectioners&#39; sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice (bottled) and the 1/2 cup crushedstrawberries.  I&#39;d pricked holes in each cake with a fork and then drizzled the glaze over each cake.  The cakes certainly ARE moist! The feedback on this cake from other readers is also VERY helpful! I think that if I made the icing again, I will concentrate on that! I&#39;ve made cakes using Jello and I often resort to making a lemon glaze or other citrus-type glaze which runs down into the baked cake, making it extra moist!  When I added the water in the amount specified, I added it slowly to the batter! delowenstein"

I used firmer strawberries so the cake held up for several days and I added a thin layer of strawberry jam with the frosting between the layers. I kept the cake in the refrigerator and it was real easy to cut. My husband said it&#39;s a keeper recipe!</p>
